===========================================================================

    *** No changes ***

===========================================================================
Version 1.0.1
===========================================================================

 - Fixed bug that swapped '+' and '-' operations by swapping enteries in itsOperations list
 - Implement parseformula algorithm (only outputting strings, and NOT a TokenList) and fixed bugs

===========================================================================
Version 1.0.2
===========================================================================

 - Cleared various warnings
 - Got rid of infix.h and prefix.h, replaced with parseformula.h. Yay, finally!

===========================================================================
Version 1.0.3
===========================================================================

 - Declared but not used warning cleared from functions[] declaration
 - Gradient function implemented using fast machine epsilon algorithm
 - Newton-raphson function implemented, only basic GUI support (simple message box with copy to clipboard)

===========================================================================
Version 1.0.4
===========================================================================

 - Swapped "+" with "-" so "+" comes first.
 - Min and max domain inputs are now handled as expressions, so things like pi*e-sin(2)*i are allowed

===========================================================================
Version 1.0.5
===========================================================================

 - Fixed domain coordinate bug (Min and max are displayed at bottom left and top right, but were
   taken as top left and bottomn right, since the array of colors starts at top left)
 - Rectangle zoom changed so that whatever corners the user starts and finishes with when selecting,
   the resulting map is the same.
 - Empty Qt form for the calculator is added, no implementation yet.
 - Removed qDebug functions from parseformula
