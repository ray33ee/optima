Long term to do list:

    - Add undo history dialog, allowing user to view and select from a list of all previous canvases. THis would take the shape of a resizable dialog containing a list of all histories with relevent information (including formula, min and max domain) and ok/cancel buttons.
    - Add root finder function to cooda.dll. Use multivariate calculus and newton-raphson method to locate zeros based on given seed. To the user this will add another togglable click interface, (on top of pan and rectangle zoom) a single click will select the seed, and draw an object on the screen at the location of the zero.
      Must account for resized screen. Object must be cleared if  a) the domain is changed to be outside the zero, b) a new function is drawn c) the user selects a different togglable click (either pan or rectangle zoom)
    - Detect when another instance of ComplexOPT is running, warn user, and disable all functionality.
    - Investigate leading double slash '//' error.


Short term to do:

    - Handle exceptions from parseformula with message boxes, do not allow user to leave drawdialog without a valid formula
    - Check formula by making sure only a single item remains on the stack after the TokenList is evaluated
    - Evaluate min and max domains from dialog as expressions
    - Add text-based calculator in the form of an inputbox
    - Any functions where all the operands are constants should be pre-evaluated. for example z*sin(2) should be sent as z*0.909297.
    - Add support for scientific notation (3.2e+22)
